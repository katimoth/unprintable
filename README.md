## Installation
To run dotti on your iPhone, Apple requires you to sign this project with a development team. You can create a personal team using your Apple ID. Follow the instructions from [lab 0](https://eecs441.eecs.umich.edu/asns/lab0-swiftChatter#creating-an-xcode-project) to create a personal team and sign dotti with it. Start reading from where it says `If you selected None` towards the end of the `Creating an Xcode project` section.

## Back End
API server: 35.227.89.255
The back end server uses ngnix and gunicorn in a Django web framework. Hosted on a GCP instance.

**YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY TIME AFTER `git pull` CHANGES YOUR CODE!**
